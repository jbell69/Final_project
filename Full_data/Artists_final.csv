28,Benbridge,Henry,Henry Benbridge,1743,1812,27,"Henry Benbridge  – February 1812) was an early American portrait painter. He was born in Philadelphia, the only child of James and Mary  Benbridge. When he was seven years old, his mother, who had been left a widow, was married to Thomas Gordon, a wealthy Scot. The boy's artistic talent was encouraged. He made decorative designs for his stepfather's drawing-room which were much admired. When he was fourteen years old he may have watched John Wollaston paint Gordon's portrait. It has been plausibly argued that young Benbridge had instruction from Wollaston, since his earliest known portrait, that of his half-sister Rebecca Gordon, ""seems to hark back to Wollaston."" When he was 21, Benbridge was sent to Italy, where he studied with Pompeo Batoni and Anton Raphael Mengs. In 1769, on commission from James Boswell, biographer of Dr. Samuel Johnson, he made a portrait of Pasquale Paoli in Corsica which he took to London. It was exhibited  at the Free Society of Artists, and from it three mezzotints were scraped and published with the artist's name signed ""Bembridge."" Like other young Americans he was encouraged by Benjamin West. He wrote, on December 7, 1769, to his stepfather: ""Upon my arrival I waited upon Mr. West who received me with a sort of brotherly affection, as did my cousin, Mrs. West."" Impelled, apparently, by a longing to rejoin his family, he left England in 1770, bearing from West the following note of recommendation to Francis Hopkinson: ""By Mr. Benbridge you will receive these few lines. You will find him an Ingenous artist and an agreeable Companion. His merit in the art must procure him great incouragement and much esteem. I deare say it will give you great pleasure to have an ingenous artist resident amongst you.""",//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/James-carroll-beckwith.jpg/220px-James-carroll-beckwith.jpg

686,Greco,El,El Greco,1540,1614,683,"Doménikos Theotokópoulos ; 1 October 1541xa0–  7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco , was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. ""El Greco"" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan.', 'a. ^  Theotokópoulos acquired the name ""El Greco"" in Italy, where the custom of identifying a man by designating a country or city of origin was a common practice. The curious form of the article  may be from the Venetian dialect or more likely from the Spanish, though in Spanish his name would be ""El Griego"". The Cretan master was generally known in Italy and Spain as Dominico Greco, and was called only after his death El Greco ).', 'b. ^  According to a contemporary, El Greco acquired his name, not only for his place of origin, but also for the sublimity of his art: ""Out of the great esteem he was held in he was called the Greek "" .', ""c. ^  There is an ongoing dispute about El Greco's birthplace. Most researchers and scholars give Candia as his birthplace. Nonetheless, according to Achileus A. Kyrou, a prominent Greek journalist of the 20th century, El Greco was born in Fodele and the ruins of his family's house are still extant in the place where old Fodele was . Candia's claim to him is based on two documents from a trial in 1606, when the painter was 65. Fodele natives argue that El Greco probably told everyone in Spain he was from Heraklion because it was the closest known city next to tiny Fodele."", 'd. ^  This document comes from the notarial archives of Candia and was published in 1962. Menegos is the Venetian dialect form of Doménicos, and Sgourafos  is a Greek term for painter.', 'e. ^  The arguments of these Catholic sources are based on the lack of Orthodox archival baptismal records on Crete and on a relaxed interchange between Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic rites during El Greco's youth. Based on the assessment that his art reflects the religious spirit of Roman Catholic Spain, and on a reference in his last will and testament, where he described himself as a ""devout Catholic"", some scholars assume that El Greco was part of the vibrant Catholic Cretan minority or that he converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism before leaving the island.', 'f. ^  According to archival research in the late 1990s, El Greco was still in Candia at the age of twenty-six. It was there where his works, created in the spirit of the post-Byzantine painters of the Cretan School, were greatly esteemed. On 26 December 1566 El Greco sought permission from the Venetian authorities to sell a ""panel of the Passion of Christ executed on a gold background""  in a lottery. The Byzantine icon by young Doménicos depicting the Passion of Christ, painted on a gold ground, was appraised and sold on 27 December 1566 in Candia for the agreed price of seventy gold ducats , equal in value to a work by Titian or Tintoretto of that period. Therefore, it seems that El Greco traveled to Venice sometime after 27 December 1566. In one of his last articles, Wethey reassessed his previous estimations and accepted that El Greco left Crete in 1567. According to other archival material—drawings El Greco sent to a Cretan cartographer—he was in Venice by 1568.', 'g. ^  Mancini reports that El Greco said to the Pope that if the whole work was demolished he himself would do it in a decent manner and with seemliness.', 'h. ^  Toledo must have been one of the largest cities in Europe during this period. In 1571 the population of the city was 62,000.', 'i. ^ El Greco signed the contract for the decoration of the high altar of the church of the Hospital of Charity on 18 June 1603. He agreed to finish the work by August of the following year. Although such deadlines were seldom met, it was a point of potential conflict. He also agreed to allow the brotherhood to select the appraisers. The brotherhood took advantage of this act of good faith and did not wish to arrive at a fair settlement. Finally, El Greco assigned his legal representation to Preboste and a friend of him, Francisco Ximénez Montero, and accepted a payment of 2,093 ducats.', 'j. ^ Doña Jerónima de Las Cuevas appears to have outlived El Greco, and, although the master acknowledged both her and his son, he never married her. That fact has puzzled researchers, because he mentioned her in various documents, including his last testament. Most analysts assume that El Greco had married unhappily in his youth and therefore could not legalize another attachment.', 'k. ^  The myth of El Greco's madness came in two versions. On the one hand Gautier believed that El Greco went mad from excessive artistic sensitivity. On the other hand, the public and the critics would not possess the ideological criteria of Gautier and would retain the image of El Greco as a ""mad painter"" and, therefore, his ""maddest"" paintings were not admired but considered to be historical documents proving his ""madness"".', 'l. ^  This theory enjoyed surprising popularity during the early years of the twentieth century and was opposed by the German psychologist David Kuntz. Whether or not El Greco had progressive astigmatism is still open to debate. Stuart Anstis, Professor at the University of California , concludes that ""even if El Greco were astigmatic, he would have adapted to it, and his figures, whether drawn from memory or life, would have had normal proportions. His elongations were an artistic expression, not a visual symptom."" According to Professor of Spanish John Armstrong Crow, ""astigmatism could never give quality to a canvas, nor talent to a dunce"".",//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Benozzo_Gozzoli.jpg

The Académie de Saint-Luc provided Labille-Guiard with a space to practice art professionally. In 1774, she exhibited her work at its Salon. This show was so successful that the Royal Academy took offence, and with the backing of the monarchy, issued an edict in March 1776 abolishing “guilds, brotherhoods, and communities of arts and crafts”, forcing the Academie de Saint-Luc to close its doors in 1777.

Labille-Guiard's talent as an oil painter and pastellist was quickly noticed and she received national recognition ultimately leading to her acceptance into the Royal Academy. On May 31, 1783, Labille-Guiard was accepted as a member of the French Academie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. Three other women were admitted as members on the same day.
